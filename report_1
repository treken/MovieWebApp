Single Instance version:
    average TS per query of 1000 queries = 22916329.708
    average TJ per query of 1000 queries = 2593063.456

    The reason is probably because the "Search" servlet contains the part of "Search" backend, where I use JDBC.
    So, the TS time contains TJ time. This is why it's bigger.


Scaled version:
    average TS per query of 1000 queries = 14133733.836
    average TJ per query of 1000 queries = 14235202.566765578

    I got the data from 2 separate logs, which are master and slave.
