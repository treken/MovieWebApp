Connection pooling for the scaled version of fabflix:
  1. I have all the statements as PreparedStatement
  2. I changed the instance 1 apache load balancer to the master and slave's private addresses
  

instance 1: ec2-52-27-63-14.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:80/fabflix
master: ec2-35-164-108-114.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
slave: ec2-52-41-85-129.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
