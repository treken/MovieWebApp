Just deploy the war file in the dist folder on TomCat server

My AWS TomCat user name is “admin” and password is “admin”

I used NetBeans as my default IDE.

You can create tables using createtable_27.sql
You can use newData.sql to populate the database.
If you want to populate the files using the data from .xml files, run the JUnit test on netbeans or eclipse because I wrote the parser in the JUnit test.

You can log into my database using “testuser” and password “testpass”, and I have granted all the permissions to this user.

I used phpMyAdmin to modify my stored procedure, and i also included the mysql file with the stored procedure in it.



Thank you for your patience and time!!!
